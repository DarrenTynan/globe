This project started out as a how-do-I use the Three.js library. But, soon morphed into how to setup a development environment consisting of: NPM, Webpack and Babel. NPM and Webpack was easy to setup, however getting Babel to play nice was a royal pita.

## How to use
Setup a local server stack and either 'npm run dev'. Or 'npm run prod' to create a dist/bundle.js

## What I learnt
* How to use NPM
* How to install and configure Webpack (webpack.config.js)
* How to use Webpack loaders for css files
* How to install and configure Babel (babel.config.js)
* Do not use .bablerc, instead use babel.config.js

## What could I improve?
* Hard to answer at this point, apart to improve my familiarity.
